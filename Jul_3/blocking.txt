I try to add a few repo names messages and departments.
Using command:
>>mix phx.gen.live Accounts User users name:string age:integer
>>mix ecto.migrate
>>iex -S mix phx.server

After using mix ecto.migrate, migrations are up already but when in the localhost, it display error.
** using chatGPT and also try to fix with cursor. Not resolve until now.
