The problem when trying to generate UI after apply the pattern matching function.
After applying the function, I need to generate it in UI so that it return a messages like "User is Male" or "User is a Female".

Solution:
So, I get help from other member to add one function in show.html.heex first: 
  <:item title="Gender">{CoffeeShop.Accounts.user_gender_range(@user)}</:item>
  <:item title="Age">{CoffeeShop.Accounts.user_age_range(@user)}</:item>
Then, successfully generate at UI.

Secondly, need to add function in index.html.heex
  <:col :let={{_id, user}} label="Gender"><%= CoffeeShop.Accounts.user_gender(user) %></:col>
  <:col :let={{_id, user}} label="Category"><%= CoffeeShop.Accounts.user_age_range(user) %></:col>
Now, can see the messages after applying the function in user table.

One more problem: cannot save input data
>>Solution: column DOB doesn't exist because some part I didn't add so, i delete DOB from schema, file user, accounts.ex and index.html.heex and show.html.heex.
